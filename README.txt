Thank you for downloading!

This mod changes the color of the Czechoslovak tanks from their default brown to an ultra-dark brown color.
Included are skins for all Czechoslovak vehicles and matching icons for the garage and tech tree.

To install:
- Drag the "res_mods" folder from inside this zip to your World of Tanks install directory (by default, C:\Games\World_of_Tanks).

I included preview images in the download ZIP file for both if you'd like to have a look before you install.

Enjoy!
